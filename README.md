# Algorithm 1: The Alternating Disk Problem
### The Problem
_The problem below is adapted from Levitin’s textbook:_

You have a row of __𝟐𝒏__ disks of two colors, __𝒏__ light and __𝒏__ dark. They alternate: light, dark, light,
dark, and so on. You want to get all the dark disks to the left hand side and all the light disks
to the right hand end. The only moves you are allowed to make are those that interchange the
positions of two neighboring disks. Design an algorithm for solving this puzzle and determine
the number of moves it takes.

__Input__: a positive integer __𝑛__ and a list of __2𝑛__ disks of alternating colors light-dark, starting with
light
__Output__: a list of __2𝑛__ disks, the first __𝑛__ disks are dark, the next __𝑛__ disks are light, and an integer
__𝑚__ representing the number of swaps to move the light ones after the dark ones
